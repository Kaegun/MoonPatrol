After the mid-term, I decided to change my project up and implement a Moon Patrol clone.
I replaced the character with the Moon Patrol ATB, trees became rock formations, clouds became moons and planets,
and I added some flair to the mountains. The pick-ups are drops from shooting the Recon Fighter.

I've added sound (from a royalty-free library that I downloaded - citations needed?)

I added 4 types of enemies
 - Standard fighters
 - Bombers
 - Recon Fighter (drops a special and plays a sound to warn the player that it's coming)
 - Mothership

 Added a base, some platforms and a shield mechanism.
