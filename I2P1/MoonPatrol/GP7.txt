Game project part 7: make it awesome

The final stage of your Game project is to make your game awesome. 
Extensions

Complete two out of four possible extensions shown below.

    Add advanced graphics

Make your graphics as pretty as possible. We don't think you need tutorials for this.

2. Create platforms

Use the factory pattern to create platforms. To do this, you'll need to wait until the next topic when a tutorial video will be provided.

3. Add sound

Use p5.sound to add sound effects to your game. Watch the tutorial video from this topic to do this.

4. Create enemies

Use a constructor function to create enemies. To do this, you'll need to wait until the next topic when a tutorial video will be provided.
Make your code awesome

Secondly,  review your code and make sure it is awesome. This means:

    Make sure your code is well formatted. If you're unsure about how to do this, then rewatch the code philosophy video "The elegant coder".
    Make sure that you have used variables, objects and functions well. The code philosophy lecture, "The elegant coder" also has help for this area.
    Make sure your code works as well as can be. Iron out those bugs. Code philosophy videos "The debugger's mindset" and "Testing" will help you in your approach to this.
